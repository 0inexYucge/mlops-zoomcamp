Abakada Unang Hakbang Sa Pagbasa is a valuable resource that can help Filipino children become confident and competent readers. By learning how to read in their mother tongue, they can also develop a deeper appreciation of their culture and identity.
  
The reading material is based on the Abakada alphabet, which is the original alphabet of the Filipino language. It consists of 20 letters that correspond to the 20 basic sounds of the language. The Abakada alphabet was introduced by Lope K. Santos in 1940 as a way to standardize the spelling and pronunciation of Filipino words.
 
The reading material follows a systematic and progressive approach to teaching reading. It starts with the letter A and its sound /a/, and then introduces the other letters and sounds in order. Each lesson also presents words that begin with the letter being taught, as well as sentences that use those words. The material also provides review and practice activities to reinforce the learning objectives.
 
The reading material is designed to be user-friendly and attractive to young learners. It uses simple and clear fonts, colorful and relevant images, and easy-to-follow instructions. It also has a cheerful and encouraging tone that motivates the children to learn and enjoy reading.
  
The reading material is aligned with the K-12 curriculum of the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines. It supports the Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) program, which aims to use the learners' first language as the medium of instruction in the early grades. The program also seeks to develop the learners' skills and competencies in other languages, such as Filipino and English.
 
The reading material is also beneficial for Filipino children who live abroad or in areas where Filipino is not widely spoken. It can help them learn and appreciate their heritage language and culture, as well as connect with their roots and identity. It can also enhance their cognitive and academic abilities, as research shows that bilingualism and multilingualism have positive effects on brain development and learning outcomes.
 
The reading material is a testament to the richness and diversity of the Filipino language and literature. It showcases the beauty and creativity of the Filipino people, as well as their values and aspirations. It also reflects the history and evolution of the language, as well as its role and significance in the society.
